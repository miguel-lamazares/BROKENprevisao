# (broken)🌤️ Weather App – Project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
This is my Weather Forecast website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch real-time weather data. The goal was to practice API integration, DOM manipulation, and improve UI/UX with icons and animations.

## 🔍 Features  
- Search any city to get current weather info  
- Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and condition  
- Dynamic weather icons using Phosphor Icons  
- Smooth interface animations with anime.js  

## 💡 Technologies Used  
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (vanilla)  
- OpenWeatherMap API  
- Phosphor Icons  
- anime.js

## 🛠 How to Run Locally  
1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/miguel-lamazares/BROKENprevisao.git
```
2. Open the index.html file in your browser.
Done! 🌈

## 🚀 Future Ideas

Add 5-day forecast

Show weather icons based on condition (e.g., rain, sun, snow)

Fully responsive design

Implement dark/light mode

Add geolocation support for current position
